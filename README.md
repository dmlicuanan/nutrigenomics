# Milkfish nutrigenomics
nutriseqs.R is an examination of available sequence data for the Slc6a family of transporters, whose functions in relation to milkfish (*Chanos chanos*) nutrigenomics will be investigated. The script performs the following: 
- Automate downloading of DNA sequences for genes Slc6a15, Slc6a16, Slc6a17, Slc6a18, Slc6a19, and Slc6a20
- Link taxonomic information associated with the downloaded sequences
- Examine the distribution of sequences across taxonomic classes
- 


- functions.R contains functions for reading and writing FASTA files
